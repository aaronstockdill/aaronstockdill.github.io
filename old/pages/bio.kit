<h2>About</h2>

<p>First and foremost, I am a student &ndash; and I love it. I'm currently studying towards a Bachelor of Science with Honours in Computer Science at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. In 2015 I completed my third (and final) year of a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics, and one day hope to study towards a PhD in Computer Science.</p>

<p>My interests lie with anything that can make the world better. This primarily manifests as education: I teach mathematics to high school students, and computer science to university students. I also work with Potato Softworks to help businesses and organisations get an online prescence with affordable websites. Personally, I am passionate about Artifical Intelligence, as is reflected in my Honours research.</p>
