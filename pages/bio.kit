<h2>About</h2>

<p>First and foremost, I am a student &ndash; and I love it. I'm currently studying towards a Bachelor of Science with Honours in Computer Science at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. I have just completed my third (and final) year of a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics, and one day hope to study towards a PhD in Computer Science.</p>

<p>My interests lie with anything that can make the world better. Right now, that means I want to help small businesses get online, to help themselves move into a new digital era. I also teach mathematics to high school students, and computer science to university students. Personally, I am passionate about Artifical Intelligence.</p>
