<h2>About</h2>

<p>First and foremost, I am a student. And I love it. I'm currently studying towards a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. While it is now my third year of this BSc, I hope to continue study with a year of Honours, and further.</p>

<p>My interests lie with anything that can make the world better. Right now, that means I want to help small businesses get online, to help themselves move into a new digital era. I also teach mathematics to high school students, and computer science to university students. Personally, I want to move towards a computational intelligence/machine learning line, as that is where my strongest passions are. </p>
