<h2>About</h2>

<p>First and foremost, I am a student &ndash; and I love it. I'm currently studying towards a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. I have just completed my third (and final) year of this BSc, and I am continuing to study with a year of Honours, and further on afterwards to a PhD in Computer Science.</p>

<p>My interests lie with anything that can make the world better. Right now, that means I want to help small businesses get online, to help themselves move into a new digital era. I also teach mathematics to high school students, and computer science to university students. Personally, I want to move towards an artificial intelligence/machine learning line, as that is where my strongest passions are. </p>
