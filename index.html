        <h2>About</h2>
<quote>I'm pretty tenacious when it comes to problems. <cite>Roger Penrose</cite></quote>

<p>First and foremost, I am a student. And I love it. I'm currently studying towards a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. While it is now my third year of this BSc, I hope to continue study with a year of Honours, and further.</p>

<p>My interests lie with anything that can make the world better. Right now, that means I want to help small businesses get online, to help themselves move into a new digital era. I also teach mathematics to high school students, and computer science to university students. Personally, I want to move towards a computational intelligence/machine learning line, as that is where my strongest passions are. </p>        <a class='continue' href='#Education'></a>

<h3>University of Canterbury</h3>
<h4>Bachelor of Science</h4>
<p>Currently in my final (third) year, double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics. Average GPA of 8.85 our of 9. I have a particular interest in Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning, and hope to continue my education down this line. I have been awarded a 2013 Computer Science High Achievers Scholarship, Peter Bryant First in 100-level Mathematics at the University of Canterbury 2013, a 2014 University of Canterbury Mathematics and Statistics Tier 2 Scholarship, and shortlisted for the 2014 Peter Windle Scholarship for Highest Academic Achievement among 100-level students. In 2015 I won the University of Canterbury Mathematics and Statistics Tier 1 Scholarship, and also the Allied Telesis Labs Scholarship in Computer Science. I also received a Dean's Congratulations of Academic Achievement 2013 from Associate Professor Catherine Moran, Dean of Sciences.</p>

<h3>Cashmere High School</h3>
<h4>NCEA Levels 1-3</h4>
<p>All Levels achieved with Excellence. I came first in school in Calculus, Statistics, Physics and Digital Technologies as well as second place in Classical History. I was awarded <i>Proxime Accessit</i> of 2012, and the Fraser and Tonkin Scholarship for Excellence in Mathematics and Sciences 2012.</p>        <a class='continue' href='#Experience'></a>

<quote>A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.<cite>Albert Einstein</cite></quote>

<h3>University of Canterbury</h3>
<h4>February 2015 - Present</h4>
<p>Other than being a student, I am also a Computer Science tutor, helping out with the first year course "Introduction to Computer Science". This is exceptionally rewarding, and also introduces me to tertiary teaching. </p>

<h3>ARANZ Geo</h3>
<h4>November 2014 - January 2015</h4>
<p>My first true internship, and software development job. This job introduced me to how a real software company works, and it also provided experience working with a real codebase, a real development style, and a real team environment. </p>

<h3>Potato Softworks</h3>
<h4>June 2014 - Present</h4>
<p>Founded Potato Softworks, a small web design and hosting company, in June 2014 with fellow student Kaleb McCall. Currently still working with the company, continuing to grow our client network and enviable skill set. I am the lead front-end developer, and am in charge of product designs. This very website is hosted by Potato Softworks. </p>

<h3>NumberWorks'nWords</h3>
<h4>April 2014 - Present</h4>
<p>Maths tutor, specialising in senior students (high school aged and up), Algebra and Calculus. Tutor since April 2014. Currently working there. </p>

<h3>Dick Smith Electronics</h3>
<h4>November 2012 - February 2013, November 2013 - April 2014</h4>
<p>Salesperson, selling various consumer electronics ranging from headphones to laptops to televisions to mobile phones. Nothing builds interpersonal and diplomacy skills faster than working in retail. Worked in both the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 Christmas holidays. </p>        <a class='continue' href='#Skills'></a>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
<quote>We can only see a short distance ahead, but we can see plenty there that needs to be done.<cite>Alan Turing</cite></quote>

<dl>
    <dt>Python <span class="stars five"></span></dt>
        <dd>Most proficient in Python 3. Comfortable with both object oriented and functional styles. This is definitely my 'go-to' language, for both client- and server-side applications. </dd>
    <dt>Lisp <span class="stars three"></span></dt>
        <dd>I have worked in Clojure mostly, dabbling in others. Love it. Macros are something that no other language has ever really got right. The C Preprocessor is not even close. </dd>
    <dt>Haskell <span class="stars one"></span></dt>
        <dd>I adore the functional style, and this meshes well with my brain. Having said that, I have barely scratched the surface. </dd>
    <dt>PHP <span class="stars three"></span></dt>
        <dd>Have done significant developments in PHP recently, although I can't say I love it. </dd>
    <dt>C/C++ <span class="stars two"></span></dt>
        <dd>I can read it and write it, although modern languages are just <em>so much nicer</em>. I've also used C++, although I know even less. </dd>
    <dt>HTML/CSS/Javascript <span class="stars five"></span></dt>
        <dd>Strong proponent of web standards, HTML5 in particular. I have recently really been enthused by the 'kit' language, so have been using it a lot over pure HTML. I often use LESS over raw CSS these days. Almost exclusively working in CSS3, and an eager user of the latest in transforms and transitions. For Javascript, I believe in using a framework when appropriate, but am happiest in vanilla Javascript. Sometimes, less really is more. Prefer functional styles to the 'prototype' object orientation, but can use both. Four years experience.</dd>
    <dt><span class='LaTeX'>LaTeX</span> <span class="stars four"></span></dt>
        <dd>These days I'd estimate 80% of my writing is done in LaTeX, and the rest is done when I need to collaborate with people outside of University. Comfortable that I can create a document efficiently, but I feel there will always be corners I don't know about. </dd>
    <dt>Unix/Linux <span class="stars four"></span></dt>
        <dd>I am comfortable on the command line, and sometimes even find it preferable. Can do shell scripting, but will generally opt for Python. </dd>
    <dt>OS X <span class="stars five"></span></dt>
        <dd>This is my daily driver, the system where I know all the tricks to get work done fast. I get all the GUI goodness of modern applications, and all the power of Unix just when I need it. </dd>
    <dt>Microsoft Windows <span class="stars five"></span></dt>
        <dd>I am able to work effectively in a Windows environment. I may not <em>like</em> it, though. </dd>
