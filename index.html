    <section id="About">
        <h2>About</h2>

<p>First and foremost, I am a student &ndash; and I love it. I'm currently studying towards a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand. I have just completed my third (and final) year of this BSc, and I am continuing to study with a year of Honours, and further on afterwards to a PhD in Computer Science.</p>

<p>My interests lie with anything that can make the world better. Right now, that means I want to help small businesses get online, to help themselves move into a new digital era. I also teach mathematics to high school students, and computer science to university students. Personally, I want to move towards an artificial intelligence/machine learning line, as that is where my strongest passions are. </p>        <a class='continue' href='#Education'></a>

<p>I worked as a first-year Computer Science tutor, helping out with &ldquo;COSC121 &ndash; Introduction to Computer Programming&rdquo; and &ldquo;COSC122 &ndash; Introduction to Computer Science&rdquo;. This is exceptionally rewarding, and also introduced me to tertiary teaching. </p>
